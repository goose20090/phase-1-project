    - Generate a joke relevant to the scenario that's been selected and have it be displayed on the DOM

    - Have a central joke dsiplay area where the most recently generated joke is displayed

    - Have a display area to the side of teh page where previously generated jokes are displayed

    - Have a random joke button that will generate a random joke
