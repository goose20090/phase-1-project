    - Select scenarios from a drop down menu that will affect the joke that's generated

    - Generate a joke relevant to the scenario that's been selected and have it be displayed on the DOM

    - Have a central joke dsiplay area where the most recently generated joke is displayed

    - Have a display area to the side of teh page where previously generated jokes are displayed

    - Have a random joke button that will generate a random joke

    - Give the opportunity for the user to submit their own joke and get it back when they select a specific option from the drop-down menu
